Just trying to make an executable as minimal as possible for simple CFD problems so that beginners like me don't get overwhelmed using other available open source CFD softwares xD

I'd be grateful if anyone wants to contribute something to this project if you're interested in solving the problem.

Also, I'd love to have suggestions and advices for me to follow for this project if you've any experience building projects in C++.
